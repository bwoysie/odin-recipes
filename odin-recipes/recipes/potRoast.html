  Family-friendly Crock-Pot recipes will never fall out of favor 
  and this slow cooker pot roast is one of the best you'll ever try.
  This recipe takes traditional, fall-apart-tender pot roast from 
  the oven to the slow cooker making it the ultimate fix-it-and-forget-it
  Sunday meal. After all, chuck roast was practically made for the 
  Crock-Pot. Lots of marbling throughout means big flavor,
  plus it becomes meltingly tender when cooked for hours at a low temperature.
  Serve it on a Sunday, for a simple holiday meal, or any time you 
  crave truly classic comfort food. The whole family will beg for
  it again and again.

  It seems like a fussy step, but browning the chuck roast in a skillet
  first leads to a delicious payoff in the end. Those browned bits in 
  the pan are packed with rich, caramelized flavorâ€”be sure to scrape 
  them up once you add the beef broth (this also makes the pan much 
  easier to clean).
