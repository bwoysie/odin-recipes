  Ackee and saltfish isn’t just Jamaica’s national dish; it’s also a 
  favorite breakfast or brunch for Jamaicans everywhere. 
  Ackee is a savory fruit with thick red skin; when unripe, the skin
  forms a sealed pod, but when the fruit ripens, the skin opens up to 
  reveal a beautiful petal-like shape containing three or four yellow 
  pegs topped with a single black seed. Native to West Africa, ackee 
  came to Jamaica along with enslaved Africans, who used its seed as 
  a talisman.

  If incorrectly prepared, fresh ackee can potentially be poisonous, 
  but it is perfectly safe to eat if harvested and prepared correctly. 
  The skin must be naturally open before picking; the pegs, once extracted 
  from the pod, are thoroughly cleaned by removing the seed and the red 
  membrane that is embedded in the flesh of the peg; the fruit is then 
  boiled in salted water. Outside of Jamaica, ackee isn’t sold fresh, 
  but it’s readily available in cans and can be found in online groceries 
  and mainstream supermarkets throughout the USA, Canada, and the UK.
